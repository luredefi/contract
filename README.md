What is LURE (LURE)?
LURE is a decentralized finance (DeFi) token. Some of the functions that will occur with LURE: Buy LP, Burn, and Growth Pool.
LURE is a combination of RFI tokenomics and an automatic liquidity generation protocol. We plan to develop a non-fungible token (NFT) exchange as well as its metaverse, as well as education projects for learning the blockchain world, our blockchain network. With LURE, token holders will earn more LURE based on the number of coins they have. LURE will gain a lot of value over time thanks to its coin burning strategy, making it a deflationary digital currency.
Among its projects, LURE will bring a coin launch platform that will allow users to create their own cryptocurrencies through the platform, which will go through a rigorous security system. LURE wants to be listed on major exchanges, launch a decentralized exchange (DEX), and grow its partnerships by the end of 2022.
